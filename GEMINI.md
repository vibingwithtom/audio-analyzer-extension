## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Development Workflow Rules

**These rules must be followed to prevent production issues:**

1.  **Feature Branch Development:**
    *   Never push directly to `main` for features or significant changes.
    *   Always create a feature branch for any new work.
    *   CI tests are automatically run on every push to a feature branch.

2.  **Testing Requirements:**
    *   All 739+ tests must pass before any code reaches production.
    *   If tests fail on your feature branch, fix them before creating a pull request.

3.  **Pull Requests:**
    *   The `main` branch is protected and requires a pull request with passing CI checks to merge.

4.  **Standard Workflow:**
    ```bash
    # 1. Create a feature branch
    git checkout -b feature/descriptive-name

    # 2. Develop and test locally
    npm run dev
    npm test

    # 3. Commit and push (triggers CI)
    git add .
    git commit -m "feat: description"
    git push origin feature/descriptive-name

    # 4. Deploy to beta for manual testing
    cd packages/web
    npm run deploy:beta

    # 5. Create a Pull Request to main
    gh pr create --base main --head feature/descriptive-name

    # 6. Merge the PR after CI passes
    ```

## Project Overview

This project is a sophisticated audio analyzer application with multiple front-ends: a web app, a Chrome extension, and a desktop application. The core functionality is provided by a shared JavaScript library, `@audio-analyzer/core`.

The application is designed to analyze and validate audio files from various sources, including local files, Google Drive, and Box. It supports batch processing, filename validation against specific patterns, and a range of audio analysis metrics, from basic properties (sample rate, bit depth) to more experimental ones like reverb and noise floor.

## Monorepo Structure

-   **`packages/core`**: The shared audio analysis engine. Key modules include:
    -   `AudioAnalyzer`: Extracts basic file properties.
    -   `LevelAnalyzer`: Performs advanced analysis (peak levels, noise floor, reverb, etc.).
    -   `CriteriaValidator`: Validates audio properties against presets.
    -   `BatchProcessor`: Handles batch processing.
-   **`packages/web`**: The main web application, a PWA built with Svelte 5 and Vite.
-   **`packages/desktop`**: An Electron-based desktop application.
-   **`packages/extension`**: A Chrome extension for analyzing audio files from Google Drive.
-   **`cloud-functions`**: Google Cloud Functions for bilingual validation and a Box API proxy.

## Building and Running

The project is a monorepo managed with npm workspaces. The primary commands are executed from the root directory.

-   **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

-   **Development:**
    ```bash
    # Run all packages in development mode
    npm run dev

    # Run a specific package (e.g., the web app)
    npm run dev --workspace=@audio-analyzer/web
    ```

-   **Building:**
    ```bash
    # Build all packages
    npm run build

    # Build a specific package (e.g., the desktop app)
    npm run build --workspace=@audio-analyzer/desktop
    ```

-   **Testing:**
    ```bash
    # Run all tests
    npm run test
    ```

## Deployment (Web App)

The web application has a sophisticated deployment process with two environments:

-   **Production:** `https://audio-analyzer.tinytech.site`
-   **Beta:** `https://audio-analyzer.tinytech.site/beta`

### Production Deployment

Production deployments are **fully automated** via GitHub Actions. Pushing to the `main` branch triggers a workflow that runs all tests and, if they pass, deploys the application.

### Beta Deployment

Beta deployments are done manually from the command line:

```bash
cd packages/web
npm run deploy:beta
```

## Key Documents

-   **`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`**: A detailed overview of the application's architecture.
-   **`packages/web/DEPLOYMENT.md`**: A comprehensive guide to the web app's deployment process.
-   **`CLAUDE.md`**: A detailed guide for AI assistants working on this project, containing critical workflow rules and in-depth architectural information.
